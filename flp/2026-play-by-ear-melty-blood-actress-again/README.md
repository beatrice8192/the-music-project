At the moment when I am making this set of play-by-ear, my composition skill is 60%, software skill is 20%, while performance skill is 10%. I learned piano with instructors from grade 2 to 10, and acoustic guitar for one school term.

Composition aspect: The music of Melty Blood are rocky, sentimental, and suitable to be repeated forever for a 2D fighting game. I cheated the play-by-ear by referencing other people's play-by-ear copies on 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 07, cleaning them up and adding my improvises. The rest of them were made from scratch.

Software aspect: As anyone can tell that I only use two patterns per music piece, one for the intro, one for the main loop.

My preferred instruments are piano, acoustic guitar, rock guitar, rock organ. I avoided using strings as much as possible as I don't have the skills to make it sound realistic in the synthesizer neither do I have the skill to perform it.

Notes:

* 01 - The end of 1000 years

* 02 - The theme of Arcueid
    * TODO: Implement genre Spicy Girls "Stop".

* 03 - Elegant summer
    * It follows a combined composition of this piece in MBAA and MBAC.
    * The piano tracks were replaced with acoustic guitar, as it is the one instrument that also fits the genre. The octave was shifted down by one to avoid going over an acoustic guitar's range.
    * The strings were replaced with rock organ.
    * The drums were improvised with more patterns, making it sound like a swing jazz, resembling School Rumble's 1st opening song "Scramble".

* 04 - Noble mind

* 05 - Basilica

* 06 - Wonderful boy

* 07 - Beat form Melty Blood

* 08 - Severe person
    * The name is not supposed to make sense. It was picked by people who weren't native speakers in English.

* 09 - Fight on! My mecha Hisui!

* 10 - Sakura koi uta

* 11 - Modernism street

* 12 - Rhythmical bustle

* 13 - Actor's anteroom

* 14 - Blood drain

* 15 - Silent fortissimo
